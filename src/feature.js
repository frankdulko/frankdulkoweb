I was able to work with a team of fantastic developers and designers, implementing design bug fixes as well as several key features, including the liking of content and including an episodes tab and episode results in search. I had the privilege to present some of these features to the wider Audacy team, and was able to witness the launch of the redesign and Work & Co’s completion of the project in August 2023.",
